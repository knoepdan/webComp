Progressive webapps needs 2 things: 
- manifest.json
- webworker

## PWA overall links

## manifest etc. (including icon)

https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/Manifest

https://www.appicon.co/  -> to generate icons


## service worker

See: https://joshuatz.com/posts/2021/strongly-typed-service-workers/   (service worker and typescript)
or see subfolder /pwaExampleCodeTS   
-> as of now.. easier to just use js file (but we need to update its content each time :-()

Vite writes some kind of manifest with the following example config (in file vite4.config.js). But I believe it's a different kind of manifest so we don't need it. 

import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    // generate .vite/manifest.json in outDir
    outDir: "dist",
    manifest: true,
    //   rollupOptions: {
    //     // overwrite default .html entry
    //     input: '/path/to/main.js',
    //   },
  },
});
